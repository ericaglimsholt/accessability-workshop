# Accessability workshop
We have went through "what", "why" and "how" about web accessability on the web. Now it's time for you to try it by yourself.

## Todo

### Installation
If you are on a Mac you can simply go to Settings > Accessability > VoiceOver > Enable. If you are on a PC, and it doesn't support VoiceOver as a native setting you can download the [NVA software](https://www.nvaccess.org/).

If you can't make the voice over to work you can to the exercise with only using your keyboard (don't turn down the brightness).

### Go to a partner portal
Ex https://macforum.smartrestaurang.com/

### Turn down your brightness
Now you are going to navigate only by using Voice over.

### Navigation
